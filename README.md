Now you can wield the power of Flashfunk in Python/Pygame. Check bullets.py for an engine demo. Has some minor differences to the Flash version where appropriate.

TODO:  
-Documentation  
-Organize neatly in a proper Python package  
-Finish porting some of the handy Flashfunk functions (tweening etc.)
